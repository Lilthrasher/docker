Welcome to my self-hosted documentation site! Here, you'll find detailed information on the various technologies I use and how I configure them. This site serves as a comprehensive guide to my personal tech stack, providing insights, configurations, and best practices that I’ve found effective.

### Technologies I Use

#### Docker & Docker Compose
I rely heavily on Docker and Docker Compose to containerize and manage my applications. This setup allows me to maintain consistent environments across different stages of development and deployment.

### Why Self-Host?

Self-hosting gives me full control over my environment and data. It allows me to customize my setup according to my specific needs and preferences. Moreover, it ensures that my tools and services are always available and tailored to my workflow.

### Getting Started

To get started, navigate through the sections in the top and sidebar. Each section is dedicated to a specific technology or aspect of my setup. Whether you’re looking for detailed configuration files, step-by-step setup guides, or troubleshooting tips, you’ll find it all here.

Thank you for visiting my documentation site. I hope you find the information useful and insightful.

Happy configuring!
